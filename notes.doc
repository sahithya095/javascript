2) can't start with numbers
3) reserved words can't be used

how to declare variables:
1.variable(var)
2.let
3.constant(const)

reassigning var, let, const is accepted
var a=1
a=8

redeclaring var is accepted
var a=0
var a=9

redeclaring const, let is not accepted

two types of data types
1. Primitive data type
2. Non-Primitive data type

to check the data type -typeof

1. Primitive data type: we an store single values
1, Numbers: Integers, floats
2, String: Stream of characters enclosed in quotes single'', double"", backtick quotes
3, Boolean: true or false
4, Null: empty value or no value
5, Undefined: declared variable with no value

condition: An expression that evaluates the result(true or false)
console.log(5>4): true

condition statement: 
To make the set if instructions execute only when the condition is true
Block of code(condition Block): set of instructions
--when this block of code will execute it will execute when the given specific condition is true

identation: {
    Block of code
}

if: only one condition is possible
